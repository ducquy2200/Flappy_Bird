# Flappy_Bird
# What does it do?
- The game is a recreation of the famous Flappy Bird mobile game from 2014 using pygame loop 
# How does it work?
- The game runs on a continuous loop after it starts
- It functions exactly like the traditional flappy bird game when it came out
- Press Enter to start the game and make the bird go up by pressing space
- The player can decide to play again by pressing enter or exit by closing the application

*Future development: I intended to make an AI using NEAT to give it the ability to play the game by itself and this would be done on a seperate repository so stay tune
